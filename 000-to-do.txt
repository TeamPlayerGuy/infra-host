Need to create a differentiation between x86 and arm, best suggestion is to create subdirs within group_vars
inventory/group_vars/arm/
inventory/group_vars/x86/

Would need to update host.yaml to represent this change as below
k8s_new_workers:
  children:
    arm:
      hosts:
        rpi5-01:
        rpi5-02:
    x86:
      hosts:
        nuc01:
        nuc02:

I belive I need to have a specific all category to pick up when running playbooks against all
As well as differentiate between architecture in the hosts.yaml file itself
all:
  children:
    k8s_new_workers:
      arm:
      x86:

Something about roles, maybe a role would be x86 versus arm

Create a fact that hashes the bootloader, determines if it's the correct bcm.dtb file, and acts upon that
